# AI-Heuristic Algorithms to Solve Travelling Salesman Problem
Solving Travelling Salesman Problem by using heuristic algorithms, such as simulated annealing algorithm, greedy approach, genetic algorithm, 2-OPT algorithm.

Also available exhaustive search algorithm to check how far heuristic algoritms from the global minima.

You can run main.js to see SA VS Exhaustive by calling sa_VS_twoOpt function. Also you can test all algorithm by calling main function.
